# The Binary Clock
## This project
### The idea behind this project was to mess about with a raspbery pi and the adafruit led 8x8 matrix (its a fnacy way of saying pixle screen)

#
## Conclusion
### I have it running on the pi as intended. However the only way i figured out to get the time to refresh was to clear the LED screen every 60 seconds.
